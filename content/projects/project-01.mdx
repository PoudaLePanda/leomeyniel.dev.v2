# Smart Home Automation System

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a centralized control system for all smart home devices, providing a seamless user experience through a custom-built dashboard and mobile application.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI
- **Database**: MongoDB for device configurations and user preferences
- **Communication Protocol**: MQTT for device communication
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi as central hub

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Design

- Evaluate existing smart home protocols (Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi)
- Design system architecture and communication flow
- Create UI/UX mockups for dashboard and mobile app

### Phase 2: Core System Development

- Set up the Raspberry Pi hub with required services
- Develop the backend API for device management
- Create the frontend dashboard with basic controls

### Phase 3: Integration

- Connect and test with various smart devices:
  - Philips Hue lights
  - Nest thermostat
  - Smart plugs and switches
  - Security cameras
- Implement automation rules engine

### Phase 4: Mobile App and Finalization

- Develop the companion mobile app
- Add voice control capabilities
- Implement security features and encryption
- User testing and refinement

## Current Progress

The project is currently in Phase 2, with the following components completed:

- Raspberry Pi hub setup with MQTT broker
- Basic API endpoints for device discovery and control
- Initial dashboard UI with device listing and basic controls

## Next Steps

1. Complete the rules engine for automation
2. Add support for more device types
3. Begin integration testing with actual hardware
4. Start development of mobile application

## Notes

The biggest challenge so far has been standardizing the communication between different device ecosystems. Each manufacturer uses their own protocols and APIs, requiring custom adapters for each system. A potential solution might be to focus on supporting the most common protocols first and adding others gradually.
